A final class cannot be inherit.

Method Overriding: ->
------------------
It suppports dynamic binding.
Also called runtime polymorphism
The scope of overridden method cannot be reduced. e.g. from default to private but default to protected is allowed.

Method Hiding: ->
--------------
Redefining static method of parent class in child class.
Static methods are iherited.
It is actually overriding and all the rules of overriding are followed.
But it is called method hiding due to certain resons.
    There is no dynamic binding or runtime polymorphism rather compile-time binding. It will be called based upon reference.
    Or, the child class method is hidden by parent class.

@override: ->
----------
Annotation. Checks the overridden method at the compile time if it doesn't matches the definition.
A final method cannot be overridden.

This: ->
-----
: Used as constructor chaining where 'this' should be the first statement.
: Used to resolve local variables within multiple objects.

--> A cycle between constructors due to this() throws an error: Recursive Constructor Invocation.

Singleton class: ->
----------------
A class which cannot be inherited and at most only one object is created.
This is possible by making the constructor private.
To receive the object of such class we need a static method in it.

--> Static method has a priviledge to be called by both object and class name.
