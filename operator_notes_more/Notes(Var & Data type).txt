Variables and Data Type
	
	byte  - 8bit
	short - 16bit
	int   - 32bit
	long  - 64bit

	float - 32bit
	double- 64bit

	char - 16 bit

	boolean -

NOTE :

 All the numbers are int by default and all the floating point numbers are double by default.


 Assigning a lower precision number to higher precision number is widening.(Automatically done)
 Assingning a higher precision number to lower precision num is narrowing.(Explicit coversion is required)

     Narrowing <=================================

A class is a template for creating an object.
An object is an instance of a class.

Memory Allocation in java is done by JVM.
Three memory areas :
1> Heap - all the objects are stored
2> Stack - all the local variables are stored
3> Class area - class members    

At most one public class in one java file.

.class file in java is called byte code. It is the thing that makes java platform independent and brings security.

All object references and variable in java is assigned a null value and no garbage value.

Variables inside the body of a class is called instance variable. As soon as an object is created, its own copy of instance variables will be created.

A variable qualified with static keyword inside the body of a class is called class variable. It has default value and is stored in class area.

Local variables are those which are created inside any block of a class. Eg: Block of constructor, method, loop, if-else, etc. No access specifier and static is allowed with local variables.
