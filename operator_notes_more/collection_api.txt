=========================================================>
We will use Vector only when we need syncronization.
Else we will use ArrayList
Collection is an interface
=========================================================>
->ArrayList provides dynamic array

->Conversion of variables to object automatically is called autoboxing.
  And reverse when done if required is called unboxing.


================
    ArrayList      
================

-> One constructor to pass the capacity 
    import java.util.*;
    default capacity is 10 theoretically
    else give the capacity explicitly
    
    But also in default case, if we access the index more than the elements present in the array then it will throw an errer.
    eg, elements are 4 and we access index 6 to insert
    Since, we have only sequential access

-> One collection to pass the collection.

-> Type inference "< >" is used to say the type of ArrayList
    ArrayList all = new ArrayList();
    ArrayList <double> all = new ArrayList<>();
